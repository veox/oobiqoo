.. _v0.1.0:

[v0.1.0] SETTING A FALLEN CROW ON FIRE DOES NOT MAKE A PHOENIX
==============================================================

Israel admits bombing suspected Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------

Re-implemented base token in LLL.

Functionality is on-par with previous Solidity implementation: that
is, it barely works as a stand-alone single token, without dispatcher
delegation or registries.


.. _v0.0.2:

[v0.0.2] THE REAPER COMES TO HARVEST
====================================

Build fast, fix later: Speed hurts Tesla
----------------------------------------

Solidity implementation of base token, as-is. Registry still a stub.

To allow easy upgradability, a much lower-level approach seems required.
Most importantly, dealing away with Solidity's storage layout scheme,
and library use quirks.

Next version is likely to be in LLL. I do not see this as a setback:
contrary, this furthers understanding of the issue at hand.

See notes in ``docs/2017-11-28-token-storage-layout.md``


.. _v0.0.1:

[v0.0.1] DEATH SHALL BE MY NAME
===============================

At least 58 die in Mexico's strongest quake in 85 years
-------------------------------------------------------

Use actual function instead of placeholder var.


.. _v0.0.0:

[v0.0.0] RDY FOR WAR
====================

South Korea braces for possible new missile test to mark North's founding day
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

`git` uses config-mode `#` to mark comments, rendering Markdown
impossible for timestamping. Python users rejoice!..
